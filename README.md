# iac-helm-lscsde-flux
This helm chart will be used to control the deployments of the various different flux configurations required for the LSCSDE


## Developer Guide
This helm release will be called by the [Core LSCSDE Flux configuration](https://github.com/lsc-sde/iac-flux-lscsde)

When the main branch of this repository is created it will trigger a github action which will:
* Calculate a semver version number
* Create a release branch with the semver version
* Create the helm package and upload to https://github.com/lsc-sde/iac-helm-repository
* Update the submodules on the main repository
* Update the chart version value on the core [lscsde flux configuration](https://github.com/lsc-sde/iac-flux-lscsde)

This will in turn trigger github actions that will propagate those changes up the chain
